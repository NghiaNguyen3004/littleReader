# File Interactions in the Audiobook Player Project

This document outlines how the various files in the audiobook player project interact with each other, detailing the flow of data and function calls throughout the application.

## Overview of File Interactions

1. **index.html**
   - Serves as the main entry point for the application.
   - Links to the CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling and JavaScript files (`app.js`, `pdfHandler.js`, `ttsConverter.js`, `audioPlayer.js`, `apiClient.js`) for functionality.
   - Provides the structure for the user interface, including elements for file upload and audio playback controls.

2. **styles.css**
   - Contains styles that enhance the visual presentation of the HTML elements defined in `index.html`.
   - Does not directly interact with other files but is essential for the user experience.

3. **app.js**
   - The main JavaScript file that initializes the application.
   - Sets up event listeners for user interactions, such as file uploads and audio controls.
   - Calls functions from `pdfHandler.js` to process uploaded PDF files and extract text.

4. **pdfHandler.js**
   - Exports functions that handle PDF file uploads.
   - Reads the uploaded PDF file and extracts text content.
   - Once text is extracted, it calls the function from `ttsConverter.js` to convert the text into audio format.

5. **ttsConverter.js**
   - Exports a function that interacts with the text-to-speech API.
   - Takes the extracted text from `pdfHandler.js` and sends it to the API via functions in `apiClient.js`.
   - Receives the audio file from the API and returns it to `pdfHandler.js` or directly to `app.js` for playback.

6. **audioPlayer.js**
   - Exports the `AudioPlayer` class that manages audio playback.
   - Receives the audio file generated by `ttsConverter.js` and provides methods to play, pause, and stop the audio.
   - Interacts with the user interface elements defined in `index.html` to control playback.

7. **apiClient.js**
   - Exports functions for making API requests to the text-to-speech service.
   - Handles authentication and data formatting required for successful API interactions.
   - Used by `ttsConverter.js` to send requests and receive audio data from the text-to-speech API.

## Data Flow Summary

1. User uploads a PDF file through the interface in `index.html`.
2. `app.js` listens for the upload event and calls `pdfHandler.js` to process the file.
3. `pdfHandler.js` extracts text from the PDF and calls `ttsConverter.js` to convert the text to audio.
4. `ttsConverter.js` uses `apiClient.js` to send the text to the text-to-speech API and receives the audio file.
5. The audio file is passed to `audioPlayer.js`, which manages playback through the interface in `index.html`.

This flow ensures a seamless experience for users, allowing them to convert PDF files into audiobooks efficiently.
